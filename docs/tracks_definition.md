## Track Assignment Logic

```python
def assign_track(
    diagnostic_score: float,
    days_until_exam: int,
    test_type: str = "academic",
    weak_module: str = None,
    daily_availability_minutes: int = 45,
    weekend_availability: bool = True
) -> str:
    """
    Rule-based track assignment (Tier 1 AI - $0 cost).
    """
    # Priority 1: Time-critical assignments
    if days_until_exam < 21:
        if test_type == "academic":
            return "academic_fast_track"
        else:
            return "general_fast_track"
    
    # Priority 2: Score-based assignments
    if diagnostic_score >= 6.5:
        return "sprint"
    
    if diagnostic_score < 5.5:
        return "foundation"
    
    # Priority 3: Module-specific weakness
    if weak_module == "writing":

## Track Transition Rules

Users may transition between tracks based on:

1. **Velocity Change**: If user consistently over/under-performs, suggest track adjustment
2. **Timeline Change**: If exam date moves, recalculate appropriate track  
3. **Weakness Identified**: If specific module weakness emerges, offer focus track

```python
def should_transition_track(user: User) -> Optional[str]:
    """Check if user should move to a different track."""
    
    # Over-performer: Completing 150%+ of planned tasks
    if user.macr > 150 and user.current_track == "professional_marathon":
        return "balanced"  # Can handle more intensity
    
    # Under-performer: Completing <40% of planned tasks
    if user.macr < 40 and user.current_track == "intensive":
        return "balanced"  # Need less intensity
    
    # Weakness emerged
    weak_module = detect_module_weakness(user)
    if weak_module and user.days_until_exam > 30:
        if weak_module == "writing":
            return "writing_focus"
        if weak_module == "speaking":
            return "speaking_focus"
    
    return None  # No transition needed
```
